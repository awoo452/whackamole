**********************************************

Notes:

This was created and worked as intened while following the youtube tutorial, but I have made a list of some changes and additions along with some issues that needed to be addressed.

Completed:

* Reset button.

* Stop the score from adding after the game is done.

* Stop the avacado from moving after the game is done.

* Maybe have different pictures of like tomatoes and onions with the avacado.

* Add a bowl that fills slowly with guacamole as the score count increases.

* Make the cursor a hammer or something.

* Start button so the game doesn't automatically start when it loads in the browser.

* Add some instructions so other people know how to play.

To add:

* Add things that don't go in guacamole that ends the game.
